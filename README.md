# XElementWrapper
Fluent Xml Parse Suport

Used this on a specific project to read and to a certain degree explain where in a WML file certain entries where being read.

I have no idea if it will be usefull again but I thought I would put it up here

I know there are several frameworks already established for getting entities from XML but they tend to be a little heavy weight. 

Knowm deficiencies: 
Its is not so sucint in dealing with namespaces. 
It is not very fast especially in explain mode
