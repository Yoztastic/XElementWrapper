# XElementWrapper
Fluent Xml Parse Support

Used this on a specific project to read and to a certain degree explain where in a WML file certain entries were being read.

I have no idea if it will be useful again, but I thought I would put it up here

I know there are several frameworks already established for getting entities from XML but they tend to be a little heavy weight. 

Known deficiencies: 
It is not so succinct in dealing with namespaces. 
It is not very fast especially in explain mode
